MNIST dataset is one of the basic problems for Machine Learning.
Here the task is to classify the handwritten digits into one of the 10 cateogries.[0-9]
I have used two approaches here, the first one with only single perceptron layer and other with using Convolution neural nets.
With single perceptron layer, I reached the efficiency of 89-90% and with CNN I achieved the efficiency of 98-99%.
